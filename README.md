# APPELLO
API for accessing the Vindolanda tablets

The APPELLO web service (API) is described in chapter 4.3 of my thesis (starting at page 102). The code in this repository was published on a CD along with my DPhil in 2011.

## From the thesis abstract:
Furthermore, the thesis demonstrates how technology such as Web Services and
XML can be used to make a DSS even more powerful through the development of the
APPELLO word search Web Service.

For this code I have added the same tablet used as an example in the DSS prototype: tablet 670 - https://web.archive.org/web/20160911201016/http://vto2.classics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/tablets/search-for-tablets?tablet=670.
Unfortunatly the Vindolanda Tablets II website that was running on this API a decade ago is no longer online, but only exists in an archived version (see links below).
The original APPELLO API call for this tablet was http://appello-vto2.csad.ox.ac.uk/?method=get_tablet&tabletID=670

(all pages load, but the original search indices don't work)

Try accessing the tablets via the lists instead.
